# Inventory Manager

## .env

The environment variables need to be set in a .env file which is placed directly in the root directory.

The structure of the .env file is as follows:

`DATABASE_URL=<turso database url>`

`AUTH_TOKEN=<turso auth token>`

NOTE: You can also set the environment variables directly in the shell if you don't want to create the .env file.
